# Changes in version 0.1.10 (2025-03-21)

- Update `module_add_HowToCite()` to work with a DESCRIPTION file
  without author doubling.
- Update `.Rbuildignore`
- Add alternative `.Rbuildignore` that is used in case `as_cran = TRUE`.
  This version ensures that snapshot tests do not become part of the
  package, keeping the `tar.gz` size small.
