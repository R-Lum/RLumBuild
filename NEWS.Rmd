# News for package 'RLumBuild'

## Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)
* Add new import from the package `'jsonlite'`
* Add support to automatically update relevant information in the `.zenodo.json` file
(if such a file exists) which are: title, description and version number.

## Changes in version 0.1.5 (2020-12-06)
* Minimum R version requirement >= 3.5.0
* Make sure that we catch all `.Rhistory` and `.RData` files in the folder
* `.Rbuildignore` knows about the zenodo 

## Changes in version 0.1.4 (2020-05-25)

* Add new module to automatically update `data/datalist` if data are shipped with the package
* Add support for code meta data: https://ropensci.github.io/codemetar
* Swap order: install now comes after the outro
* .Rbuildignore update to exclude log-files that needed to be excluded
* Slightly improve 'module_add_HowToCite()` to avoid missing whitespace between the package name and the package version
* Add `module_compactVignette()` to ensure that the PDF vignettes are not larger in size than needed

## Changes in version 0.1.3 (2019-07-31)

* Remote checks were not activated by default if `as-cran` was `TRUE`, this 
led to less rigour tests. 

## Changes in version 0.1.2 (2019-07-30)

### `module_add_HowToCite()`

* Silence warnings by removing the cause
* Function now creates and addiational BIB-file with all the function citations in it
* If now patter `URL` was set in the DESCRIPTION file this module did not work

## Changes in version 0.1.1 (2019-05-08)

* Add build order: NEWS and README are created after the documentation was 
created, this allows customised scripts in the RMD-files and the version number
is always consistent with the number from the build.

* Update and complete documentation

* `module_add_HowToCite()` now checks the URL field in the DESCRIPTION file and double
checks this URL

* `module_add_RLumTeam()` was never working and activated; now ok.


## Changes in version 0.1.0 (2019-05-03)

* Initial version
