# News for package 'RLumBuild'

## hanges in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

### `module_add_HowToCite()`

* Silence warnings by removing the cause
* Function citations are now also part of the created BIB-file

## Changes in version 0.1.1 (2019-05-08)

* Add build order: NEWS and README are created after the documentation was 
created, this allows customised scripts in the RMD-files and the version number
is always consistent with the number from the build.

* Update and complete documentation

* `module_add_HowToCite()` now checks the URL field in the DESCRIPTION file and double
checks this URL

* `module_add_RLumTeam()` was never working and activated; now ok.


## Changes in version 0.1.0 (2019-05-03)

* Initial version
