# Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

* Update `module_add_HowToCite()` to work with a DESCRIPTION file without author doubling.
* Update `.Rbuildignore `
* Add alternative `.Rbuildignore` that is used in case `as_cran = TRUE`. This version 
ensures that snapshot tests do not become part of the package, keeping the `tar.gz` size
small.
