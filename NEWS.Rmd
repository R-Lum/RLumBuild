# News for package 'RLumBuild'

## Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

* Add build order: NEWS and README are created after the documentation was 
created, this allows customised scripts in the RMD-files and the version number
is always consistent with the number from the build.

## Changes in version 0.1.0 (2019-05-03)

* Initial version
